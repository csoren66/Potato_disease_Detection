Problem Statement 
Farmers who grow potatoes are often plagued by serious financial losses each year, which lead to several diseases that affect potato plants. The diseases Early Blight and Late Blight are the most common diseases. Early blight is caused by fungus, and late blight is caused by specific micro-organisms.

There are different treatments for early blight and late blight, so it's important to be accurate in identifying the type of disease present in your potato plant. Behind the scenes, we will use Convolutional Neural Network - Deep Learning to diagnose plant diseases
